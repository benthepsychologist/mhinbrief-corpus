# CLAUDE.md — mhinbrief (standing instance)

A **standing** instance tended by the kestrel engine (/workspace/kestrel): a
curated corpus of records, each carrying a source and a verified-as-of
date, with an **append-only changelog**. This repo is the data; a paired
site or outward channel is the rendered surface; the engine is the
machinery. `kestrel.yaml` at this root is the instance manifest
(`kind: standing`).

**The loop:** `/tend` (sweep declared sources → stage candidates, if this
instance declares any) → `/curate` (candidates → records,
operator-confirmed, citation-required) → `/verify` (scheduled
re-verification) → `/publish` (**Operational** — `publish/adapter.py` exists in this repo.). Skills live in
`.claude/skills/` — rendered kit copies; canonical versions live in the
engine's `library/` (edit there, then `/sync-kits`).

**The posture, non-negotiable:** this corpus states what it tracks with
receipts. The runner never writes records; the agent drafts and the
**operator confirms every record change**; no change is asserted without
a source and a verified-as-of date (mechanically checked, not habitual).
When a claim can't be sourced primary, it stays a deferred candidate or
ships flagged `confidence: low` — never laundered.

**This file is deliberately thin on domain specifics.** Kestrel doesn't
know this instance's real subject, voice, or safety rules beyond the
shared curate/tend/verify/publish mechanics above — those belong in this
repo's own operating contract (its README/AGENTS.md content, hand-
authored, never rendered).

**Never:** edit `records/` outside `/curate`'s mechanics · modify an
existing `changelog/` file (append-only) · hand-write content into an
outward channel once its adapter exists (single content writer) · let an
LLM-edited YAML go unvalidated (`yaml.safe_load` or revert).
