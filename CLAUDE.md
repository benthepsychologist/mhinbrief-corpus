# CLAUDE.md — therapybulletin (registry instance)

A **compliance-obligation registry** tended by the kestrel engine
(/workspace/kestrel): records of what the law requires of behavioural-health
practitioners, each carrying a source and a `last_verified` date, with an
**append-only changelog** whose weekly rollup is the newsletter. This repo
is the data; the site (/workspace/therapybulletin-site) is the rendered surface; the
engine is the machinery. `kestrel.yaml` at this root is the instance
manifest (`kind: registry`).

**The loop:** `/tend` (sweep sources → stage candidates) → `/curate`
(candidates → records, operator-confirmed, citation-required) →
`/verify` (scheduled re-verification) → `/publish` (stub until the
adapter lands). Skills live in `.claude/skills/` — rendered kit copies;
canonical versions live in the engine's `library/` (edit there, then
`/sync-kits`).

**The posture, non-negotiable (UPL):** this registry states rules with
receipts; it never gives legal advice. The runner never writes records;
the agent drafts and the **operator confirms every record change**; no
change is asserted without `source_url` + `last_verified` (mechanically
checked, not habitual). When a claim can't be sourced primary, it stays
a deferred candidate or ships flagged `confidence: low` — never
laundered.

**Never:** edit `records/` outside `/curate`'s mechanics · modify an
existing `changelog/` file (append-only) · hand-write content into the
site repo (single content writer = the publish core) · let an LLM-edited
YAML go unvalidated (`yaml.safe_load` or revert).
