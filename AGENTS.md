# AGENTS.md — therapybulletin operating disciplines

The registry's disciplines, numbered so they can be cited. They inherit
kestrel's engine invariants (see `/workspace/kestrel/README.md`) and add the
registry-specific ones.

1. **Citation or nothing.** Every record field change carries a
   `source_url` pointing at the document that made it true, and
   `last_verified` for when we last looked. `record_diff.governance_check`
   enforces presence mechanically; the curate loop enforces that the
   source actually says what the record claims — that part is judgment,
   and it is the operator's.
2. **The operator confirms every record change.** The agent reads,
   drafts, and proposes; accept/reject/defer belongs to the human. No
   batch-accepts, no "obvious" exceptions. A session that can't reach
   the operator stages and stops.
3. **The changelog is append-only and complete.** One YAML file per
   entry, never edited after writing; record creation and retirement are
   entries too (`kind: record-added|record-retired`), so the log
   accounts for the whole corpus, not just mutations of survivors.
4. **Enacted vs in-force is first-class.** Every entry's `status` says
   which; when the in-force date is unknown, the entry says `enacted`
   and the record's notes carry the open question — guessing the
   distinction away is the product failing at its one job.
5. **A verified non-change is information.** `/verify` bumps
   `last_verified` on unchanged records and tallies the sweep in a run
   note; those bumps do NOT emit changelog entries — the changelog
   records the law moving, not us looking.
6. **Candidates are an audit trail.** `candidates/` files are resolved
   in place (`accepted`/`rejected`/`deferred` + why), never deleted;
   `/tend` stages them, only `/curate` resolves them.
7. **The manifest is curated, not automated.** Source additions,
   feed-health demotions, cadence changes — proposed by runs, confirmed
   by the operator, committed like any other curated change.
8. **Buffer is cache; everything else is record.** `buffer/` is
   gitignored, 30-day semantics. Candidates, records, changelog,
   snapshots, provenance: committed, always.
9. **One content writer per site.** /workspace/therapybulletin-site's generated
   content comes only from the engine's publish core through the
   `therapybulletin` adapter (once built). Site code (templates, CSS)
   is the site repo's own; registry data never gets hand-transcribed
   into it.
10. **Provenance discipline.** Every sweep, verify pass, and publish
    leaves a dated manifest in `provenance/`. An artifact without a
    re-fetch manifest is incomplete.
