# AGENTS.md — therapybulletin operating disciplines

The registry's disciplines, numbered so they can be cited. They inherit
kestrel's engine invariants (see `/workspace/kestrel/README.md`) and add the
registry-specific ones.

1. **Citation or nothing.** Every record field change carries a
   `source_url` pointing at the document that made it true, and
   `last_verified` for when we last looked. `record_diff.governance_check`
   enforces presence mechanically; the curate loop enforces that the
   source actually says what the record claims — that part is judgment,
   and it is the operator's.
2. **The operator confirms every record change.** The agent reads,
   drafts, and proposes; accept/reject/defer belongs to the human. No
   batch-accepts, no "obvious" exceptions. A session that can't reach
   the operator stages and stops.
3. **The changelog is append-only and complete.** One YAML file per
   entry, never edited after writing; record creation and retirement are
   entries too (`kind: record-added|record-retired`), so the log
   accounts for the whole corpus, not just mutations of survivors.
4. **Enacted vs in-force is first-class.** Every entry's `status` says
   which; when the in-force date is unknown, the entry says `enacted`
   and the record's notes carry the open question — guessing the
   distinction away is the product failing at its one job.
5. **A verified non-change is information.** `/verify` bumps
   `last_verified` on unchanged records and tallies the sweep in a run
   note; those bumps do NOT emit changelog entries — the changelog
   records the law moving, not us looking.
6. **Candidates are an audit trail.** `candidates/` files are resolved
   in place (`accepted`/`rejected`/`deferred` + why), never deleted;
   `/tend` stages them, only `/curate` resolves them.
7. **The manifest is curated, not automated.** Source additions,
   feed-health demotions, cadence changes — proposed by runs, confirmed
   by the operator, committed like any other curated change.
8. **Buffer is cache; everything else is record.** `buffer/` is
   gitignored, 30-day semantics. Candidates, records, changelog,
   snapshots, provenance: committed, always.
9. **One content writer per site.** /workspace/therapybulletin-site's generated
   content comes only from the `therapybulletin` adapter — **built
   2026-07-31**, living at `publish/adapter.py` in this repo (the kit
   template still reads "once built"; stale for this instance). It calls
   the engine's publish core for the guarantees. Site code (templates,
   CSS, hand-authored editorial pages) is the site repo's own; registry
   data never gets hand-transcribed into it. A second writer is the
   failure mode: a temporary bridge script in the site repo once produced
   the map data and was absorbed into the adapter and deleted the day the
   adapter landed.
10. **Provenance discipline.** Every sweep, verify pass, and publish
    leaves a dated manifest in `provenance/`. An artifact without a
    re-fetch manifest is incomplete.

<!-- ---- LOCAL ADDENDUM, not kit-synced — added directly in this repo's
     rendered AGENTS.md, deliberately, per Ben 2026-07-31. The canonical
     template above this line still lives at kestrel's
     library/agentdocs/registry/AGENTS.md.tmpl and still governs;
     `kit.py sync` will flag this file `dirty` on a future library bump
     because of this section — that's expected, resolve it with
     `install --adopt` (pulls this addendum's text back into the
     canonical template, itself a kestrel-repo write) or `--skip` (keeps
     this file exactly as-is), never `--discard`, which would silently
     delete this section. If this rule ever proves generic enough to
     want in the canonical template for every data instance, that's a
     kestrel/INBOX/ proposal (see discipline 11 below), not a direct
     edit — including of the template that defines this very file. -->

11. **Jurisdiction is explicit, not assumed.** This agent/session has
    direct authority over `therapybulletin-data` and `therapybulletin-site`
    — commit and push either without asking first, on request or on
    reasonable judgment. **kestrel is not in that jurisdiction.** Ben,
    2026-07-31, verbatim in spirit: "put requested changes to kestrel in
    the kestrel/INBOX/, got it?" Any change kestrel needs — a skill fix,
    a template bug, a new kit feature — gets written up as an
    `INBOX/<date>-therapybulletin-data-<slug>.md` entry there (format:
    global CLAUDE.md's "Handing dev work to another repo" section) and
    left for kestrel's own resident agent or Ben, not committed directly
    from here. This reverses the looser reading from earlier the same
    day (when the `/start` kit-mismatch fix was made directly in
    kestrel, with Ben's live sign-off at the time) — that was fine in
    the moment, but the standing rule going forward is INBOX, not direct
    edits, unless told otherwise again.
