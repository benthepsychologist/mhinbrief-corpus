# AGENTS.md — mhinbrief operating disciplines

This instance's shared disciplines, numbered so they can be cited. They
inherit kestrel's engine invariants (see `/workspace/kestrel/README.md`) and
add the ones every **standing**-kind instance shares. This file is
deliberately silent on this instance's own subject, voice, or safety
rules — those belong in this repo's own hand-authored contract content,
layered alongside this file, never generated here.

1. **Citation or nothing.** Every record field change carries a source
   and a verified-as-of date. `record_diff.governance_check` enforces
   presence mechanically; the curate loop enforces that the source
   actually says what the record claims — that part is judgment, and it
   is the operator's.
2. **The operator confirms every record change.** The agent reads,
   drafts, and proposes; accept/reject/defer belongs to the human. No
   batch-accepts, no "obvious" exceptions. A session that can't reach the
   operator stages and stops.
3. **The changelog is append-only and complete.** One YAML file per
   entry, never edited after writing; record creation and retirement are
   entries too, so the log accounts for the whole corpus, not just
   mutations of survivors.
4. **A verified non-change is information.** `/verify` bumps the
   verified-as-of date on unchanged records and tallies the sweep in a
   run note; those bumps do NOT emit changelog entries — the changelog
   records the tracked thing moving, not us looking.
5. **Candidates are an audit trail.** Pending-item files are resolved in
   place (`accepted`/`rejected`/`deferred` + why), never deleted; `/tend`
   (if this instance runs it) stages them, only `/curate` resolves them.
6. **The manifest is curated, not automated.** Source additions, feed-
   health demotions, cadence changes — proposed by runs, confirmed by
   the operator, committed like any other curated change.
7. **Buffer is cache; everything else is record.** `buffer/` is
   gitignored, 30-day semantics (if this instance uses it). Candidates,
   records, changelog, snapshots, provenance: committed, always.
8. **One content writer per outward channel.** Generated content into
   any declared channel comes only from this instance's own adapter,
   which calls the engine's publish core for the guarantees. Site/channel
   code (templates, hand-authored editorial pages) is that channel's own;
   this corpus's data never gets hand-transcribed into it.
9. **Provenance discipline.** Every sweep, verify pass, and publish
   leaves a dated manifest in `provenance/`. An artifact without a
   re-fetch manifest is incomplete.
10. **`yaml.safe_load` or revert.** Every YAML this session or the engine
    touches.
11. **Jurisdiction is explicit, not assumed.** This agent/session has
    direct authority over mhinbrief (and its site sibling, if
    one is declared) — commit and push either without asking first, on
    request or on reasonable judgment. **kestrel is not in that
    jurisdiction.** Any change kestrel needs — a skill fix, a template
    bug, a new kit feature — gets written up as an
    `INBOX/<date>-mhinbrief-<slug>.md` entry there (format: the
    global CLAUDE.md's "Handing dev work to another repo" section) and
    left for kestrel's own resident agent or Ben, never committed
    directly from here.
12. **Kit edits go to the library, not here.** This file and this
    instance's skills are rendered kit artifacts — canonical templates
    live in kestrel's `library/`; a wanted change is the discipline 11
    brief above, not a direct edit.
