# /verify — the re-verification pass

The off-season half of the cadence (`cadence.verify:` in `kestrel.yaml`,
quarterly by default, where this instance runs one). The failure mode for
a standing resource is not wrong content — it is **silently old
content**. This pass is the mechanical answer: every claim gets
re-checked against its source on a schedule, and a verified non-change is
recorded as information.

## The pass

1. **Select** — every record in `records/` whose verified-as-of date is
   older than the verify cadence, worst first. Report the count before
   starting; if the tail is long, say how much this session will cover
   rather than silently sampling.
2. **Re-check each against its own source** (and the current primary
   source if a URL has rotted — a dead source link is itself a finding:
   fix the link as a field change through the normal `/curate` mechanics,
   citation and all).
   - **Unchanged** → bump the verified-as-of date to today on the record.
     No per-field changelog entry (the changelog records the tracked
     thing moving, not us looking) — the sweep's run note carries the
     tally.
   - **Changed** → do NOT edit inline as part of verification. Stage it
     as a candidate (source, quote, what moved) and run it through
     `/curate` with the operator — a verify pass that quietly rewrites
     records is `/curate` without the operator, which is the thing this
     kit exists to prevent.
3. **Feed health re-probe** (if this instance runs `/tend`) — for each
   declared source, does its feed/page still behave as its `health:`
   verdict claims? Stale verdicts get proposed updates (manifest edits
   are curation acts — propose, don't silently rewrite).
4. **Run note** — append one dated entry to `provenance/` (same shape as
   a collect manifest): records checked, unchanged count, staged-changed
   count, link-rot findings, feed-health proposals.

## Close

Commit the pass in one commit: bumped records, any staged candidates, the
run note. Report the tally plainly — "N checked, all unchanged" is a
strong, publishable result, not a boring one.
