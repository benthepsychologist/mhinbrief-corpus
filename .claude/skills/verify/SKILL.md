# /verify — the re-verification pass

The off-season half of the cadence (`cadence.verify:` in `kestrel.yaml`,
quarterly by default). The failure mode for a compliance resource is not
wrong content — it is **silently old content**. This pass is the
mechanical answer: every claim gets re-checked against its primary source
on a schedule, and a verified non-change is recorded as information.

## The pass

1. **Select** — every record in `records/` whose `last_verified` is older
   than the verify cadence, worst first. Report the count before starting;
   if the tail is long, say how much this session will cover rather than
   silently sampling.
2. **Re-check each against its own `source_url`** (and the current
   primary source if the URL has rotted — a dead source link is itself a
   finding: fix the link as a field change through the normal `/curate`
   mechanics, citation and all).
   - **Unchanged** → bump `last_verified` to today on the record. No
     per-field changelog entry (the changelog records the law moving,
     not us looking) — the sweep's run note carries the tally.
   - **Changed** → do NOT edit inline as part of verification. Stage it:
     write a candidate into `candidates/` (source, quote, what moved)
     and run it through `/curate` with the operator — a verify pass that
     quietly rewrites records is `/curate` without the operator, which
     is the thing this kit exists to prevent.
3. **Feed health re-probe** — for each source in the manifest, does its
   feed/page still behave as its `health:` verdict claims? Stale
   verdicts get proposed updates (manifest edits are curation acts —
   propose, don't silently rewrite).
4. **Run note** — append one dated entry to `provenance/` (same shape as
   a collect manifest): records checked, unchanged count, staged-changed
   count, link-rot findings, feed-health proposals.

## Close

Commit the pass in one commit: bumped records, any staged candidates, the
run note. Report the tally plainly — "N checked, all unchanged" is a
strong, publishable result, not a boring one; it is exactly the claim the
site's per-page `last verified` stamps are made of.
