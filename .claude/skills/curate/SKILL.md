# /curate — candidates → records, with the operator, never without

The registry loop's judgment half, and the skill that carries the UPL
spine: **the agent drafts, the operator confirms, and no record change is
asserted without a citation.** A record here is a claim about what the law
requires of a practitioner — the entire product is that these claims carry
receipts. A curate session that shortcuts this is worse than no session.

## The loop

Walk `candidates/*.yaml` with `status: staged`, oldest first. For each:

1. **Read the source.** Open the candidate's `source.url`. Judge: does
   this item actually change, add, or retire an obligation a record
   tracks (or should track)? Most gazette items won't — rejection is the
   common case and is fine.
2. **Draft, don't assert.** For a real change, draft the record edit (new
   record in `records/` or field changes to an existing one) and show the
   operator: the field(s), old → new, the exact source quote that
   supports it, and the proposed `status` (`enacted` vs `in-effect` —
   first-class, never guessed; if the in-force date is unknown, say so
   and use `enacted`).
3. **Wait for the operator's word.** Accept / reject / defer is theirs.
   No confirmation in-session → the candidate stays `staged`. Never
   batch-accept.
4. **On accept, the mechanics are mandatory, in order:**
   - the record edit MUST carry `source_url` + `last_verified` (today) —
     run the check, don't eyeball it:
     `python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'/workspace/kestrel/tools'); import record_diff as rd, yaml; print(rd.governance_check(yaml.safe_load(open('<record>')), ['source_url','last_verified']))"`
     — a non-empty result blocks the accept, full stop.
   - diff proposed vs committed with `record_diff.diff_records()` and
     write one changelog entry per change via `write_changelog_entry()`
     into `changelog/` (append-only; the writer refuses to modify an
     existing file by construction).
   - `yaml.safe_load` every file you wrote; a parse failure reverts the
     write (kestrel discipline: safe-load-or-revert).
5. **Resolve the candidate in place** — append to its YAML:
   `status: accepted` + `record_id: <id>` + `resolved: <date>`, or
   `status: rejected` + `reason: <one line>` (kept, not deleted — the
   candidate trail is part of the audit record). `deferred` keeps
   `staged` with a `note:`.

## Confidence and honesty

- A change you can't source to a primary document gets
  `confidence: low` on the record and says so in the changelog entry —
  or better, stays deferred until it can be sourced. Never launder a
  secondary claim into a confident record.
- `last_verified`-only bumps (re-verification with no substantive
  change) do NOT emit per-field changelog entries — that's `/verify`'s
  lane, recorded in its run note; the changelog stays a record of the
  law moving, not of us looking.

## Close

Summarize: candidates walked / accepted / rejected / deferred, changelog
entries emitted, records touched. Commit everything in this repo in one
curate commit. The weekly changelog rollup IS the newsletter — a clean
curate session is literally writing the product.
