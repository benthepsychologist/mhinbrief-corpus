# /curate — candidates → records, with the operator, never without

This kind's judgment half, and the skill that carries its spine: **the
agent drafts, the operator confirms, and no record change is asserted
without support.** A record here is a claim this corpus is standing
behind — the entire product is that these claims carry receipts. A
curate session that shortcuts this is worse than no session.

## The loop

Walk pending candidates — `candidates/*.yaml` with `status: staged` if
this instance runs `/tend`, or wherever this instance's own upstream
process delivers them otherwise (an `INBOX/` review queue, for example) —
oldest first. For each:

1. **Read the source.** Judge: does this item actually change, add, or
   retire something a record tracks (or should track)? Most items won't
   — rejection is the common case and is fine.
2. **Draft, don't assert.** For a real change, draft the record edit (new
   record in `records/` or field changes to an existing one) and show the
   operator: the field(s), old → new, the exact source/quote that
   supports it, and the proposed status.
3. **Wait for the operator's word.** Accept / reject / defer is theirs.
   No confirmation in-session → the candidate stays pending. Never
   batch-accept. Rejection is the no-op, not a failure state.
4. **On accept, the mechanics are mandatory, in order:**
   - the record edit MUST carry a source and a verified-as-of date — run
     the check, don't eyeball it:
     `python3 -c "from kestrel.record_diff import governance_check; import yaml; print(governance_check(yaml.safe_load(open('<record>')), ['source_url','last_verified']))"`
     — a non-empty result blocks the accept, full stop.
   - diff proposed vs committed with `record_diff.diff_records()` and
     write one changelog entry per change via `write_changelog_entry()`
     into `changelog/` (append-only; the writer refuses to modify an
     existing file by construction).
   - `yaml.safe_load` every file you wrote; a parse failure reverts the
     write (kestrel discipline: safe-load-or-revert).
5. **Resolve the candidate in place** — append to its record:
   `status: accepted` + `record_id: <id>` + `resolved: <date>`, or
   `status: rejected` + `reason: <one line>` (kept, not deleted — the
   candidate trail is part of the audit record). `deferred` keeps it
   pending with a `note:`.

## Confidence and honesty

- A change you can't source to a primary reference gets
  `confidence: low` on the record and says so in the changelog entry —
  or better, stays deferred until it can be sourced. Never launder a
  secondary claim into a confident record.
- Re-verification with no substantive change does NOT emit a per-field
  changelog entry — that's `/verify`'s lane, recorded in its own run
  note. The changelog stays a record of the tracked thing moving, not of
  us looking.

## Close

Summarize: candidates walked / accepted / rejected / deferred, changelog
entries emitted, records touched. Commit everything in this repo in one
curate commit.
