# /publish — send this corpus out through its adapter(s)

**Operational** — `publish/adapter.py` exists in this repo. The adapter is instance-owned, declared by this repo's
own `kestrel.yaml` `outputs.adapter` — once it exists, it is the **single
writer** into each channel it targets (AGENTS.md discipline 9, the same
invariant every kestrel-tended instance shares). An instance may have
more than one outward channel (a site, a newsletter, whatever this
instance's real outlets are) — that fan-out is this instance's own
adapter's design, not kestrel's; the engine's publish core gives the same
guarantees regardless of how many destinations one run touches.

## Run

    python3 publish/adapter.py             # staged: writes, does NOT push
    python3 publish/adapter.py --dry-run   # report only, writes nothing
    python3 publish/adapter.py --push      # commit, push, fire whatever this
                                            # instance's deploy path actually is

Default is staged. Review the diff, then re-run with `--push`. What
"push" means is this instance's own adapter's business — a git push to a
sibling site repo, an API call, whatever the real channel needs.

## Guarantees it preserves

It imports `/workspace/kestrel/kestrel/publish/core.py` for `secret_scan()`
(every emitted byte), `apply_allowlist()`, `write_provenance_manifest()`,
and (for any git-backed channel) `push_site()`. This skill does not
prescribe `core.run()` or `core.referenced_only()` — those assume
attention's specific payload shape (threads/board); a standing instance's
own records/changelog orchestration goes through the same core for the
same guarantees, in the same order, every time, whatever its own shape is.

**The allowlist is load-bearing, not ceremony.** Internal curation
commentary (operator scope calls, "retire candidate", verification-split
warnings, anything not meant to ship) belongs on the exclude side of the
allowlist, checked after every publish.

## Still true from every kind's version of this skill

- Do NOT hand-write "generated-looking" content into an outward channel
  once an adapter exists for it. The adapter is the only writer; a second
  one is exactly the drift discipline 9 exists to prevent.
- Hand-authored, channel-native material (a site's own template chrome,
  an editorial page that isn't generated from this corpus) is that
  channel's own and is edited there directly — this invariant governs
  *generated* exports from this corpus, not everything in the
  destination.

## Close

Report: what was published, to which channel(s), files written, the
provenance receipt path, and — if `--push` — confirmation the channel
actually updated. **A clean write is not evidence a channel updated** —
verify against what the channel actually serves.
