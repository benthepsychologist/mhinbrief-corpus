# /publish — STUB, gated on the therapybulletin adapter

**This skill is not operational yet, and says so rather than pretending.**

Publishing this registry to /workspace/therapybulletin-site requires a
`publish/adapter.py` in **this repo** (`/workspace/therapybulletin-data/publish/`,
declared via this repo's own `kestrel.yaml` `outputs.adapter` — adapters
are instance-owned, not engine code, revised 2026-07-31) — the component
that turns `records/` + `changelog/` into the site's matrix pages,
changelog page, and data JSON, under `/workspace/kestrel/tools/publish/core.py`'s
guarantees (secret scan, field allowlists, no-empty-wipe). Per kestrel
`ROADMAP/DESIGN.md` §6, that adapter is designed but **not built**.

Until it exists:

- The site (/workspace/therapybulletin-site) is editorial-only — its content is
  hand-authored site code, not generated registry exports.
- Do NOT hand-write "generated-looking" registry content into the site
  repo to bridge the gap — that breaks the single-content-writer
  invariant the eventual adapter depends on, and creates pages the
  adapter would later fight.
- When the adapter lands, this stub is replaced via `/sync-kits` with
  the real skill (run staged, review the diff, `--push` deploys — every
  push to the site's main is a production deploy).

If you were asked to publish and reached this stub: report the gate
plainly and point at the adapter (in **this** repo, not kestrel) as the
next work item.
