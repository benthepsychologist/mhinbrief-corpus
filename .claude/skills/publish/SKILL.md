# /publish — render the corpus to the site, through the adapter

**Operational since 2026-07-31.** The adapter is `publish/adapter.py` in
**this** repo (instance-owned, declared by `kestrel.yaml`'s
`outputs.adapter`), and it is the **single content writer** into
/workspace/therapybulletin-site (AGENTS.md discipline 9).

## Run

    python3 publish/adapter.py             # staged: writes, does NOT push
    python3 publish/adapter.py --dry-run   # report only, writes nothing
    python3 publish/adapter.py --push      # commit, push, fire the deploy hook

Default is staged. Review the diff in the site repo, then re-run with
`--push`. **Every push to the site's main is a production deploy.**

## What it emits

- `content/changelog/<stem>.md` — one page per changelog entry. The
  weekly rollup of these IS the newsletter.
- `data/records.yaml` — allowlisted record fields, grouped by topic and
  by jurisdiction, for the matrix/hub templates.
- `data/regulators.yaml` — the jurisdiction map's per-province regulator
  list, built from `kestrel.yaml`'s `sources`.

## Guarantees it preserves

It imports `/workspace/kestrel/tools/publish/core.py` for `secret_scan()`
(every emitted byte), `apply_allowlist()`, `write_provenance_manifest()`
and `push_site()`. It deliberately does NOT use `core.run()` or
`core.referenced_only()` — those are attention-kind shaped (threads,
board, payload) and a registry has no such objects; the orchestration is
registry-shaped but keeps the same guarantees in the same order.

**The allowlist is load-bearing, not ceremony:** `notes` is excluded
because it carries internal curation commentary (operator scope calls,
"retire candidate", verification-split warnings). Verify after any
publish that none of that leaked into the built site.

## Still true from the original stub

- Do NOT hand-write "generated-looking" registry content into the site
  repo. The adapter is the only writer; a second one is exactly the drift
  discipline 9 exists to prevent. (A temporary bridge script once existed
  for the map data — it was absorbed into the adapter and deleted.)
- Site code (templates, CSS, hand-authored editorial pages like
  `method.md`) is the site repo's own and is edited directly. The
  invariant governs *generated* registry exports, not site chrome.

## Close

Report: records and changelog entries published, files written, the
provenance receipt path, and — if `--push` — the commit range and whether
the deploy hook actually fired. **A clean `git push` is not evidence the
site updated**: this site does not auto-deploy on push (see
therapybulletin-site/README.md). Verify against served content.
