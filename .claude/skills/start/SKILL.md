description: Session-bootstrap card for a standing-kind instance — fuses the generic continuation ritual (docs, memory, git log) with this instance's own pipeline state (candidates by status, changelog/record counts, source health if this instance runs /tend, provenance freshness, push safety).

# /start — pick up this corpus where it was left

This is the standing-kind sibling of `attention/start`, not one generic skill with
a few lines swapped: an attention instance's session state lives in
digests, expectations, and a flash rail; a standing instance's lives in
`candidates/`, `records/`, `changelog/`, and (if this instance declares
`sources:`) per-source feed health — two different pipelines, so two
different cards. The kit renderer resolves this file in place of
this file for any instance whose `kestrel.yaml` declares
`kind: standing` (family `standing` renders after family `common`, same
skill name, so it wins — KITS.md §2's selection rule, not a special
case). It runs both a continuation pass and a pipeline-state pass and
renders one card, in this order:

1. **Continuation briefing** — read the canonical docs at repo root
   (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`; say
   plainly if one is missing rather than silently skipping it), then this
   project's persistent memory directory (`MEMORY.md` + every file it
   links, in full — standing preferences and prior feedback that won't
   show up in the repo's own docs). Then `git log --oneline` since
   STATUS.md's own "As of" date (or `-20`, whichever is more informative)
   and `git status --short`. **No `log.md` read here** — the
   session-close ledger is an attention-kind convention; a standing
   instance's `AGENTS.md` carries no equivalent unless this instance's
   own docs add one, so don't go looking for one by default. Frame the
   synthesis around continuation: what changed last, what's still open,
   what's next — not a raw dump of any of these reads.
2. **Candidate queue** — read `candidates/*.yaml` (if this instance uses
   that convention — some standing instances get candidates from
   elsewhere, e.g. an `INBOX/` review queue; adapt this step to wherever
   this instance's own pending-item store actually is) and tally by
   status (staged / accepted / rejected / deferred). Report the pending
   count as the headline number (that's the queue `/curate` will walk)
   and name the oldest pending item's date — not urgent the way a missed
   expectation is, but a queue that's sat untouched across multiple
   sweeps is worth a line.
3. **Corpus state** — count `records/` (excluding `.gitkeep`) and read
   the newest few `changelog/*.yaml` entries (append-only, so newest file
   mtime is the newest change on record). Zero records is a normal,
   reportable state pre-population (`README.md` should already say so —
   flag it if the doc and the directory disagree).
4. **Source health** (only if `kestrel.yaml` declares `sources:`) — for
   each, report `health.verdict` and how stale `health.last_probe` is. A
   verdict other than `live` (e.g. `feed-empty`) is only a problem if the
   manifest hasn't already adapted to it — check whether `method:` for
   that source is already the demoted value (`page-diff` for a dead
   feed) per `feed_health: auto-demote` in `governance:`; if the verdict
   says broken but the method still says `rss`, that's a real gap to
   flag, not the expected steady state.
5. **Provenance + snapshot freshness** — newest file in `provenance/`
   names the last `/tend` or `/verify` run and when (if this instance
   runs either); a `verify-*` run note (once `/verify` has run at least
   once) separately from `collect-*`/`/tend` manifests. For any source on
   `method: page-diff`, the newest `snapshots/*.meta.json` mtime is its
   last diffed-against baseline — note if it looks older than that
   source's declared `cadence`.
6. **Push safety** — run `git log @{u}..` in this instance's repo, the
   engine (`/workspace/kestrel` — mechanical only, never auto-pushed), and
   its site sibling if this instance has one declared (check
   `kestrel.yaml`'s `outputs.site` — not every standing instance has a
   site yet). **A clean `git status` is not evidence of this** — only
   `git log @{u}..` is. Any repo with unpushed commits is the headline
   flag of the whole card, not a footnote at the bottom.
7. **Doc drift check** — compare STATUS.md's own "As of" date and its top
   note's claims against the commits since that date (already in hand
   from step 1's git log). Flag anything the top note asserts that the
   newest commits have already overtaken; fix nothing — just name the
   drift.
8. **Name the obvious next move** — one plain line, e.g. "9 candidates
   staged, nothing curated yet — run `/curate`" or "queue's empty and
   sources are live, good window for other work" — don't leave it for
   the reader to infer from the briefing above it.

## Rules

1. **Read-only, always.** `/start` never edits `candidates/`, `records/`,
   `changelog/`, or `kestrel.yaml`, never writes an artifact, never
   commits, never publishes. It only reads.
2. **Reuse, don't duplicate.** Where `/tend`, `/curate`, or `/verify`
   already specifies how to read a file or compute a state (candidate
   resolution states, the feed-health demotion rule, what counts as a
   changelog entry), point at that command's section instead of writing
   a second recipe that can drift out of sync with it.
3. Formatting follows the same house style as every other skill card:
   one-line verdict up top, bullets with bold lead terms, a table wherever
   facts enumerate cleanly (candidate counts by status, source health by
   source), status emojis as anchors, a horizontal rule between the major
   sections above.
4. If nothing is wrong anywhere in the card, say that plainly — a clean
   `/start` is a real, useful finding, not a step to pad out.
