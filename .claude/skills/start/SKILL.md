description: Session-bootstrap card for a registry instance — fuses the generic continuation ritual (docs, memory, git log) with the registry pipeline's live state (candidates by status, changelog/record counts, source health, provenance freshness, push safety across three repos). Read-only; run at the start of any session.

# /start — pick up the registry where it was left

This is the registry-kind sibling of `common/start`, not that skill with a
few lines swapped: an attention instance's session state lives in digests,
expectations, and a flash rail; a registry instance's lives in
`candidates/`, `records/`, `changelog/`, and per-source feed health — two
different pipelines, so two different cards. The kit renderer resolves
this file in place of `common/start` for any instance whose `kestrel.yaml`
declares `kind: registry` (family `registry` renders after family
`common`, same skill name, so it wins — KITS.md §2's selection rule, not a
special case). It runs both a continuation pass and a pipeline-state pass
and renders one card, in this order:

1. **Continuation briefing** — read the canonical docs at repo root
   (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`; say
   plainly if one is missing rather than silently skipping it), then this
   project's persistent memory directory (`MEMORY.md` + every file it
   links, in full — standing preferences and prior feedback that won't
   show up in the repo's own docs). Then `git log --oneline` since
   STATUS.md's own "As of" date (or `-20`, whichever is more informative)
   and `git status --short`. **No `log.md` read here** — the
   session-close ledger is an attention-kind convention
   (`AGENTS.md` §Session close on that family); the registry AGENTS.md
   carries no equivalent, so don't go looking for one. Frame the
   synthesis around continuation: what changed last, what's still open,
   what's next — not a raw dump of any of these reads.
2. **Candidate queue** — read `candidates/*.yaml` and tally by `status`
   (`staged` / `accepted` / `rejected` / `deferred`). Report the `staged`
   count as the headline number (that's the queue `/curate` will walk)
   and name the oldest staged item's date — a staged candidate isn't
   urgent the way a missed expectation is, but a queue that's been
   sitting for multiple `/tend` cycles untouched is worth a line.
3. **Corpus state** — count `records/` (excluding `.gitkeep`) and read
   the newest few `changelog/*.yaml` entries (append-only, so newest
   file mtime is newest law-change on record). Zero records is a normal,
   reportable state pre-population (`README.md` should already say so —
   flag it if the doc and the directory disagree). The changelog's
   weekly rollup is the newsletter (`CLAUDE.md`'s framing) — its emptiness
   or freshness is product state, not housekeeping.
4. **Source health** — read `kestrel.yaml`'s `sources:` list. For each,
   report `health.verdict` and how stale `health.last_probe` is. A
   verdict other than `live` (e.g. `feed-empty`) is only a problem if the
   manifest hasn't already adapted to it — check whether `method:` for
   that source is already the demoted value (`page-diff` for a dead
   feed) per `feed_health: auto-demote` in `governance:`; if the verdict
   says broken but the method still says `rss`, that's a real gap to
   flag, not the expected steady state.
5. **Provenance + snapshot freshness** — newest file in `provenance/`
   names the last `/tend` or `/verify` run and when; a `verify-*` run
   note (once `/verify` has run at least once) separately from `collect-*`
   `/tend` manifests. For any source on `method: page-diff`, the newest
   `snapshots/*.meta.json` mtime is its last diffed-against baseline —
   note if it looks older than that source's declared `cadence`.
6. **Push safety** — run `git log @{u}..` in **all three** repos:
   `/workspace/therapybulletin-data` (this data repo), `/workspace/kestrel` (the engine —
   mechanical only, never auto-pushed), and `/workspace/therapybulletin-site` (the site
   — currently editorial-only per the publish stub, so its own commits
   are hand-authored, not pipeline output, but still worth the same
   check). **A clean `git status` is not evidence of this** — only
   `git log @{u}..` is. Any repo with unpushed commits is the headline
   flag of the whole card, not a footnote at the bottom.
7. **Doc drift check** — compare STATUS.md's own "As of" date and its top
   note's claims against the commits since that date (already in hand
   from step 1's git log). Flag anything the top note asserts that the
   newest commits have already overtaken; fix nothing — just name the
   drift.
8. **Name the obvious next move** — one plain line, e.g. "9 candidates
   staged, nothing curated yet — run `/curate`" or "queue's empty and
   sources are live, good window for manifest work" — don't leave it for
   the reader to infer from the briefing above it.

## Rules

1. **Read-only, always.** `/start` never edits `candidates/`, `records/`,
   `changelog/`, or `kestrel.yaml`, never writes an artifact, never
   commits, never publishes. It only reads: repo-root docs, the memory
   directory, git (log/status, all three repos), `candidates/*.yaml`,
   `records/`, `changelog/*.yaml`, `kestrel.yaml`, `provenance/`, and
   `snapshots/`.
2. **Reuse, don't duplicate.** Where `/tend`, `/curate`, or `/verify`
   already specifies how to read a file or compute a state (candidate
   resolution states, the feed-health demotion rule, what counts as a
   changelog entry), point at that command's section instead of writing
   a second recipe that can drift out of sync with it.
3. Formatting follows the same house style as every other skill card:
   one-line verdict up top, bullets with bold lead terms, a table wherever
   facts enumerate cleanly (candidate counts by status, source health by
   source), status emojis as anchors, a horizontal rule between the major
   sections above.
4. If nothing is wrong anywhere in the card, say that plainly — a clean
   `/start` is a real, useful finding, not a step to pad out.
