# /tend — sweep the sources, stage the candidates

The registry loop's mechanical half. Runs the engine's manifest-driven
runner against this instance, then reports what it staged — **it never
writes a record** (the runner STOPs at candidates by design; kestrel
DESIGN §5's UPL discipline is structural, not a habit).

## Run

    python3 /workspace/kestrel/tools/tend.py /workspace/therapybulletin-data

`--dry-run` first if you want the source-selection plan without fetches.
`--source <id>` scopes to one source.

## Then report, scannable

- **Per-source verdicts** — the runner prints them; relay the ones that
  matter: `changed` page-diffs, feeds that failed, anything `UNHANDLED`.
- **Candidates staged** — count + one line each (new files in
  `candidates/`). Zero staged on a quiet week is a normal, correct
  outcome — say so plainly rather than padding.
- **Feed health** — a source whose feed lied (200-but-empty, years-stale)
  is registry data: flag it for a `method: page-diff` demotion in
  `kestrel.yaml`'s `sources:` (the governance rule is `feed_health:
  auto-demote`; the manifest edit itself is a curation act — propose it,
  don't silently rewrite the manifest mid-run).

## Close

Commit the run's artifacts in THIS repo (buffer is gitignored; candidates,
provenance, and snapshots are not): one commit, provenance manifests
included. If candidates were staged, say that `/curate` is the next move.
